class CharNoiseAugmenter:
    r"""Add noise into text according to a noise level measured between 0 and 1.

    It will add noise to a string by modifying each character
        according to a probability and a list of actions.
        Possible actions are `insert`, `swap`, `substitute` and `delete`.

    For actions `insert` and `substitute`, new characters are drawn from `character_set`
        which is the set of ascii letters (lower and upper) by default.
    The `swap` action swaps 2 consecutive characters,
        but **one character can not be swapped twice**.
        So if a pair of characters has been swapped,
        we move to the next pair of characters.

    With enough samples, the CER of the output tends to the noise level
        (terms and conditions may apply,
        see details in [docs/how_this_works.md](how_this_works.md)).

    Args:
        noise_level: between 0 and 1, it corresponds to the level of noise to add to the
            text. In most cases (see details above for caveats),
            the Character Error Rate of the output will converge to this value.
            For `swap` actions, it is impossible to have a CER greater than 0.54214,
            so an exception is raised in this case.
        actions: list of actions to use to add noise. Available actions are *insert*,
            *swap*, *substitute* and *delete*.
            Defaults to `[insert, swap, substitute, delete]`.
        character_set: set of characters from which character will be drawn for
            *insert* or *substitute* actions. Defaults to string.ascii_letters.
        seed: A seed to ensure reproducibility.
            Defaults to `None`.

    Raises:
             ValueError: If the action is not one of the available actions.
